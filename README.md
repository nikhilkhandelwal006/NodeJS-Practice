### Chapter 2: **Web Server & Node.js**
- Set up a basic web server using Node.js.
- Handle HTTP requests and responses.
- Understand the asynchronous and non-blocking nature of Node.js.

### Chapter 3: **Node.js**
- Dive deep into Node.js core features.
- Learn about the event loop, asynchronous programming, and handling callbacks.
- Understand the use of Promises and async/await.

### Chapter 4: **REST API and CRUD**
- Build RESTful APIs with Node.js.
- Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with HTTP methods.
- Structure API endpoints for scalability and flexibility.

### Chapter 5: **MVC and Filesystem**
- Implement the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern in Node.js applications.
- Learn to structure your project for separation of concerns.
- Handle files and directories using the FS module for better organization.

### Chapter 6: **MongoDB Basics and Atlas**
- Introduction to MongoDB, a NoSQL database.
- Set up and connect to MongoDB using MongoDB Atlas.
- Learn basic CRUD operations and how to manage data in MongoDB.

### Chapter 7: **Mongoose, Schema, and CRUD**
- Work with MongoDB using Mongoose (ODM - Object-Document Mapper).
- Define schemas to structure your data.
- Perform CRUD operations on a MongoDB database.

### Chapter 8: **Connecting with React**
- Integrate your Node.js backend with a React front-end.
- Set up API communication between your backend and the client-side.
- Use fetch or Axios for sending requests and receiving data.

### Chapter 9: **Deployment on Live Cloud Server**
- Deploy your Node.js app on a live cloud server (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean).
- Set up environment variables and configuration for production.
- Ensure that your application is scalable and reliable in a cloud environment.

### Chapter 10: **Server-side Rendering with EJS**
- Use EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for server-side rendering in Node.js.
- Learn the benefits of server-side rendering for SEO and performance.
- Dynamically render HTML on the server based on user requests.

### Chapter 11: **Authentication using JWT**
- Implement authentication and authorization in Node.js applications.
- Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication.
- Understand how to protect routes and verify user credentials.

### Chapter 12: **Events, Streams, Socket.IO**
